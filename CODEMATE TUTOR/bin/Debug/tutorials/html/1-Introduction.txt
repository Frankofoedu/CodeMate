HTML Introduction
What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, A markup language is a set of markup tags, HTML documents are described by HTML tags, Each HTML tag describes different document content

HTML Example
A simple HTML document is written as ;
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Explanation of the example

    The DOCTYPE declaration defines the document type to be HTML.
    The text between <html> and </html> describes an HTML document.
    The text between <head> and </head> provides information about the document.
    The text between <title> and </title> provides a title for the document.
    The text between <body> and </body> describes the visible page content.
    The text between <h1> and </h1> describes a heading.
    The text between <p> and </p> describes a paragraph.

Using this description, a web browser can display a document with a heading and a paragraph.

What are HTML Tags

HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets:
(angle bracket)tagname(angle bracket)content(angle bracket) slash tagname(angle bracket)

    HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>.
    The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag.
    The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a slash before the tag name.

	The start tag is often called the opening tag. The end tag is often called the closing tag.
What are Web Browsers.

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
HTML Page Structure.

Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:
<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
	Only the <body> area (the white area) is displayed by the browser.
The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration helps the browser to display a web page correctly.

There are different document types on the web.

To display a document correctly, the browser must know both type and version.

The doctype declaration is not case sensitive. All cases are acceptable.
